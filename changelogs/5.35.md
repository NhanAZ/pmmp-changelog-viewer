# 5.35.0
Released 3rd October 2025.

This is a support release for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.21.111.

**Plugin compatibility:** Plugins for previous 5.x versions will run unchanged on this release, unless they use internal APIs, reflection, or packages like the `pocketmine\network\mcpe` or `pocketmine\data` namespace.
Do not update plugin minimum API versions unless you need new features added in this release.

**WARNING: If your plugin uses the `pocketmine\network\mcpe` namespace, you're not shielded by API change constraints.**
Consider using the `mcpe-protocol` directive in `plugin.yml` as a constraint if you're using packets directly.

## Interim releases
If you're upgrading from 5.32.x directly to 5.35.0, please also read the following changelogs, as the interim releases contain important changes:
- [5.33.0](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/blob/5.35.0/changelogs/5.33.md) - internals improvements, API improvements and new gameplay features
- [5.34.0](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/blob/5.35.0/changelogs/5.34.md) - significant performance improvements, new gameplay features, new API additions and network changes

Please also note that an updated PHP binary is required due to changes introduced in 5.34.0 (initial `ext-encoding` integration).

## General
- Added support for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.21.111 (@dries-c).

# 5.35.1
Released 20th October 2025.

## Fixes
- Fixed crash when using an almost-broken trident. (@dktapps)
- Fixed AABBs of squid, zombies and villagers not matching Bedrock. (@Wraith0x10).
- Fixed `StringToItemParser->override()` not updating results of `lookupAliases()`. (@dktapps, @RenzMc)
- Fixed players' on-ground state not updating correctly when noclip is enabled outside of Spectator mode. (@dktapps)

## Documentation
- Added guidelines against copy-pasting AI code in `CONTRIBUTING.md`. (@dktapps)
- Simplified various parts of `CONTRIBUTING.md` to make it more readable. (@dktapps)

## Internals
- `PrepareEncryptionTask` now checks the validity of the provided client public key in the constructor. This ensures earlier error reporting when used incorrectly. Previously it would crash during the `AsyncTask`, preventing the source of the error from being traced. (@dktapps)
